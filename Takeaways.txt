This file is to showcase to myself as well as curious readers to the things I've learned working on this project.

Had a sudden realization with server-rendered application vs full-stack applications. In my undergrad classes such as Software Engineering
and Net-App Development, typically when handling what to do with data at the end of a function we would typically do something like
res.render(...) or something similiar if it was a differnet language. Point is, we handled the rendering / directly interact with the UI in
the backend because (ofc) we didn't really have a frontend. As opposed to if we are working with a frontend, all I have to respond
back with in the backend is a json. The frontend will handle the rendering, all they need from me is the data needed / json. 

Earlier in this project before I decided to create a 'whatIlearned' section, I also learned about JSON Web Tokens.
They're pretty cool and to my understanding it's like an alternative to sessions / cookies that I'm more familiar with in undergrad.
I learned what they are, how to create, verify, and keep track of them. Not too bad to get the gist of.

Also earlier (lol), I learned how to use postman! This was a tool I had came accross during my capstone project but at the time
I didn't really understand what the point of it was or how to use it. But with the help of ChatGPT, I understood the power of postman 
and how it helps make my life easier especially when wanting to test out my code and verifying if my endpoints do what I want them to.
I didn't have to create an entire frontend and form page to test out my routes lol! i can just use postman! 

I admit this is probably a very elementry usage and understanding of postman, I'm sure it's capable of much more but I have exposure and a foundation now!
